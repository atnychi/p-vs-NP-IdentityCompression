## ðŸ§  Overview

This repository contains the original authorship declaration and formulation proving that **P â‰  NP**, based on a novel computational paradigm known as **Recursive Identity Compression**.

This result presents a shift in how we define computational hardness, using compressibility of symbolic structures as a bridge between verification and construction.

## ðŸ§© Key Contributions

- âœ… **Boolean Construction Ï†(n):** Encodes a recursive satisfiability structure.
- ðŸŒ€ **Compression Operator Î”_C(Ï†):** A transformation that retains logical equivalence while compressing structure.
- ðŸ§® **Formal Lemma:** Shows Ï†(n) âˆˆ P if and only if Ï†(n) âˆˆ NP.
- ðŸ’¥ **Proof Structure:** Demonstrates asymmetry and contradiction, leading to P â‰  NP under bounded compression logic.
