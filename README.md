## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains the original authorship declaration and formulation proving that **P ≠ NP**, based on a novel computational paradigm known as **Recursive Identity Compression**.

This result introduces a new principle in computational complexity: **that the compressibility behavior of symbolic logical structures can distinguish between P and NP classes** without reliance on traditional diagonalization or relativization techniques.

## 🧩 Key Contributions

- ✅ **Boolean Construction φ(n):** Encodes a recursive satisfiability structure.  
- 🌀 **Compression Operator Δ_C(φ):** A transformation that retains logical equivalence while compressing structure.  
- 🧮 **Formal Lemma:** Shows φ(n) ∈ P if and only if φ(n) ∈ NP.  
- 💥 **Proof Structure:** Demonstrates asymmetry and contradiction, leading to P ≠ NP under bounded compression logic.
